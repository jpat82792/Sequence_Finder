# Sequence_Finder
<h2>Current State: </h2>
While not quite ready for a fully packaged release sequence finder can be launched from a python 3 environment to help you find sequences of both peptide and nucleotide sequences. If you have any problems please open an issue and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

  <li>Add input validation</li>
  <li>Add tests</li>
  <li>Add tutorial for end users</li>
  <li>Add documentation for developers</li>
  <li>Create release packages for Mac, Windows, and Linux</li>
</ol>
